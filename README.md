#Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student with a strong interest in mobile app development and software engineering. I specialize in building cross-platform applications using Flutter and Dart, and I also enjoy working with **Java and C++ to develop efficient and scalable solutions.

In addition to coding, I have a creative side â€” Iâ€™m passionate about graphic design, which helps me bring a polished visual touch to the apps and interfaces I create. I believe great design and great functionality go hand in hand.

ðŸ’¡ I'm always exploring new technologies, sharpening my skills, and working on real-world projects to grow as a developer and designer. I'm a team player who values clean code, clear communication, and creative problem-solving.

Letâ€™s connect and collaborate on something awesome! ðŸš€
